## Introduction
This project aims to provide a unique solution to control social media addiction by using password encryption. The concept involves creating a mechanism that encrypts user passwords, making it impossible to access social media platforms without the necessary keys. 

## Features
- Password encryption: The host and supervisor each encrypt a part of the password, which is then sent to a secure server.
- Server-side encryption: The server further encrypts the password using the provided keys and sends back an encrypted object.
- Result retrieval: The user can then receive the encryption result via email or choose to download the separate results as files.

## Installation
This project is currently in development. Installation instructions will be provided once the application is ready for use.

## Usage
The application is designed to be used by two individuals: the host, who owns the social media account, and the supervisor, who holds the host accountable. Both the host and supervisor possess a key they use to encrypt the password. Without these keys, the code remains encrypted and inaccessible.

## Contribute
We are looking to expand our team. If you are passionate about mental health and have skills in programming, we would love to hear from you. Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Limitations
The success of the application relies heavily on the supervisor's involvement. If the supervisor is not committed to the process, the host may easily fall back into old habits. Additionally, the process of encrypting and decrypting passwords can be cumbersome for some users.

## Future Improvements
We are actively exploring ways to streamline the encryption and decryption process without compromising the effectiveness of the application. We are also eager to receive feedback from our users to help us improve the tool.

## Disclaimer
While we strive to create a helpful tool, the creator of this application is not liable for any form of loss as a result of using this software. Users are encouraged to use this tool as part of a comprehensive approach to managing their social media use.
